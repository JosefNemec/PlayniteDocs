## Adding games
---------------------

### Adding games from library plugins/3rd party services
See [Installing and configuring additional Library integrations](../features/extensionsSupport/installingExtensions.md#installing-and-configuring-additional-library-integrations)

### Adding emulated games
See [Adding Emulated Games](../features/emulationSupport/addingEmulatedGames.md)

### Manually

- **Method #1:** Drag and drop game executable or shortcut to Playnite's window.
- **Method #2:** Scan directory for multiple games/apps via Add Game -> Scan Automatically menu.
- **Method #3:** Use Add Game -> Manually menu. Using this method requires manual configuration of game's Play action, otherwise you won't be able to launch the game.
Play time tracking

> [!NOTE]
> If play time tracking doesn't work after manually importing a game, try switching different tracking mode. You can do it on Actions tab while editing a game. Folder tracking usually helps as an alternative tracking method with problematic games.

### Importing Windows Store or Xbox App games

> [!NOTE]
> Since Playnite 7 it's now recommended to use [Xbox library plugin](https://playnite.link/addons.html#XboxLibrary_Builtin) for easier import of MS Store and Xbox Game Pass games!

To import Windows Store application:

1. Navigate to `Main menu` > `Add game` > `Microsoft Store applicationâ€¦`
2. Select the Microsoft Store or Xbox App Game you want to import
3. The list will be populated with applications Playnite detected as installed on your PC
4. Select games you want to import and press Add Games
