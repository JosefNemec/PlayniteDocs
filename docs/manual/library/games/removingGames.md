> Uninstalling a library plugin does not remove its games. For more information, refer to [here](faq.md#i-uninstalled-a-library-plugin-but-its-games-are-still-there-why).

### Import exclusion list
When removing game(s) imported by library plugins that import games from third party services you'll be asked if you wish to add the games to Playnite's "Exclusion list". If you accept, this will make Playnite ignore these games in future library updates and prevent them from being imported to your library.

You can manage this exclusion list in `Settings` under the `Import Exclusion List` section.
