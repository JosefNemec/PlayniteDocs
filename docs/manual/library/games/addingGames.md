## Adding games
---------------------

### Adding games from library plugins/3rd party services
See [Installing and configuring additional Library integrations](../../features/extensionsSupport/installingExtensions.md#installing-and-configuring-additional-library-integrations)

### Adding emulated games
See [Adding Emulated Games](../../features/emulationSupport/addingEmulatedGames.md)

### Manually

**Method #1**

Drag and drop the game executable or shortcut onto Playnite's window. This action will open a game edit window with certain properties automatically configured.

**Method #2**

Scan a directory for multiple games/apps by selecting `Add Game` > `Scan Automatically` from the menu.

**Method #3**

Use `Add Game` > `Manually` menu. Using this method requires manual configuration of the game's [Play Actions](gameActions.md), otherwise you won't be able to launch the game.

> [!NOTE]
> If play time tracking doesn't work after manually importing a game, try switching to a different tracking mode. You can do it on the Actions tab while editing a game. `Folder` tracking usually helps as an alternative tracking method with problematic games.

### Importing Windows Store or Xbox App games

> [!NOTE]
> Since Playnite 7 it's now recommended to use [Xbox library plugin](https://playnite.link/addons.html#XboxLibrary_Builtin) for easier import of MS Store and Xbox Game Pass games!

To import a Windows Store application:

1. Navigate to `Main menu` > `Add game` > `Microsoft Store applicationâ€¦`
2. Select the Microsoft Store or Xbox App Game you want to import
3. The list will be populated with applications Playnite detected as installed on your PC
4. Select the games you want to import and press `Add Games`
