Playnite not only helps you manage and play games but also offers support for importing and launching other software applications. Here's how to import and organize your software library.

### Importing Software

To open the **Software Tools** window, navigate to `Main menu` -> `Library` -> `Software Tools`.

In this window, you can add software tools to launch directly from Playnite. Click the `Add` button to create a new entry, or use `Import fileâ€¦` to streamline the software information setup.

Enabling the **Show on sidebar** option will make this software display in the sidebar for quick access.

### Launching Imported Software

You can launch the imported software in several ways:

1. Right-click the Playnite icon in the tray and navigate to `Tools`.

2. If you've enabled the `Show on sidebar` option for your imported software, you'll find it conveniently located in the sidebar.
