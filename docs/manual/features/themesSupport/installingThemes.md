## Additional features in themes

### Additional functionality

Custom themes not only transform the visual aspect of Playnite but can also introduce additional functionality.

The specific enhancements and additions can vary between themes, making it advisable to consult the theme's documentation for detailed information.

### Custom UI elements

Extensions can provide custom elements to Playnite that custom themes can use, ranging from videos, logos, achievements, additional data like HowLongToBeat, DLC, reviews, news... The possibilities are endless!

You can browse the Playnite addons database to explore and find what is available.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently it is required to use custom themes to use any additional custom UI element provided by extensions. It's also required that the specific theme supports the specific element provided by the plugin to display and use it.

### Configuring themes

Currently Playnite doesn't offer a native way to configure themes but a community solution is available with the [ThemeModifier extension](https://playnite.link/addons.html#playnite-thememodifier-plugin), which provides a way for custom themes for Desktop Mode to offer configuration options for users.
