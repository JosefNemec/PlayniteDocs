### What are the best extensions that I should install?

The "best" extensions to install depend on your specific needs and preferences. Playnite's extension library offers a variety of options, and what's best for one user may not be ideal for another.

Generally, a safe suggestion for everyone is installing additional metadata providers such as [Universal Steam Metadata](https://playnite.link/addons.html#Universal_Steam_Metadata) and [SteamGridDB Metadata Provider](https://playnite.link/addons.html#SteamGridDB_Playnite_Metadata) as they provide metadata for a great variety and number of games for most fields, including icons, covers, among others.

Feel free to browse the Playnite addons database and experiment with different extensions to discover the ones that suit your needs. Another suggestion is to ask for opinions in the Playnite community.

### Are extensions safe to use?

Playnite extensions developed by the Playnite development team are perfectly safe. However, as with any internet-downloaded software, there are potential risks. While none of the community-made extensions have had any issues so far in the many years of Playnite's existence, it's important to exercise caution:

- **Only install extensions from trusted sources:** Download extensions only from trusted sources, like the official Playnite database. An extension being available on the database means that many other users are using the extension and have not reported an issue of this kind, which minimizes the likehood of an extension being malicious.

- **Consider code review:** Community extensions are not reviewed by the Playnite development team as it's not a feasible thing to do but advanced users can consider reviewing and compiling extension source code offers the highest level of security.

In summary, while Playnite's official extensions are safe, it's wise to use common sense and take precautions when installing extensions to ensure a secure experience.

### Can I find and download extensions from third-party sources?

While it's possible to find extensions from third-party sources, it's recommended to download extensions from the official Playnite addons database or official comunities. These sources offer extensions that are more likely to be safe.

### Do I need to update extensions manually?

No, Playnite can automatically check for updates to your installed extensions if they are availabe in the Playnite addons database. If updates are available, Playnite will prompt you to install them with a notification. This ensures that you have the latest features and bug fixes for your extensions.

### Can I disable or uninstall extensions if I no longer need them?

Yes, you can disable or uninstall extensions at any time. Navigate to `Main menu` > `Add-ons` > `Installed` , select any of the available sub-sections, choose the extension you want to disable or uninstall and click the button on the right side.
