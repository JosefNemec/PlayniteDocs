## Filters

---------------------

Filters allow you to quickly sort and organize your game library based on various criteria such as genre, platform, tags, and more and only view the games you want in the Playnite interface.

**On Desktop Mode:**

This can be achieved by opening the **Filter Panel** and selecting the filters you want in each field.

**Tip:** An effective and quick way to switch filters is with the **Explorer Panel**. Selecting an item in this panel will automatically apply this item to the **Filter Panel**
