# Emulation Support

## Overview

---------------------

Playnite offers robust support for game emulation, allowing you to play retro and classic games using various emulators.

This section provides an overview of emulation support in Playnite, including how to add new emulators, configure the emulator scan, and add emulated games to your library.

> [!NOTE]
> It's highly recommended to use automatically imported emulators and built-in profiles for better game import experience. Some built-in emulators (for example RPCS3 and ScummVM) use more advanced import mechanism than just matching file names and you won't be able to utilize it with custom profiles.

> [!NOTE]
> Playnite currently doesn't have built-in support for any arcade emulator. You will have to configure those manually. Built-in support for more well known arcade emulators will be added [in future](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/2407). If you are having issues with non-arcade emulators, please open GitHub issue (games not being imported or launched properly).
