### How does Playnite work?

Whether your games are spread across different services or are local installations, Playnite keeps them organized and easily accessible in one place.

If you're seeking an efficient solution for managing your game library, Playnite is your go-to choice.

### Is Playnite safe to use?

Its safety largely depends on how the installed library and other types of plugins work and what they do, as they handle various aspects of game integration and other functionality. When connecting accounts, it primarily relies on the practices implemented by these plugins, such as using official login web forms and storing web session cookies or tokens, similar to how your web browser does when you log in to these services but the specifics will vary from plugin to plugin.

When it comes to your user data, you can rest assured as all information about your gaming library is stored exclusively on your PC. This guarantees that your data remains securely within your control at all times.
