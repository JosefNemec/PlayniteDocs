### Why is Playnite so cool!!?

That's just how it is. ðŸ˜Ž

### Will there be Linux or macOS version?

Not in near future, mainly for technical reasons. More information [here](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/59).

### Does Playnite replace game clients?

No. While this will vary depending on the specific library plugin in charge of handling the service library, generally Playnite does not replace game clients like Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, or others. Playnite is designed to complement these game clients by providing a unified library and interface for all your games, regardless of where they are purchased or installed.

While Playnite provides a robust and feature-rich game library management solution, it does not replace the need for the original game clients. You may still require these clients to access platform-specific features like games downloading, installing and uninstalling, multiplayer, friends, or community features offered by the games respective clients.

Playnite works alongside these clients to provide a centralized and organized gaming experience.

### Can I link multiple accounts?

You can't, unless a library integration plugin explicitly supports it (gives you an option to link multiple accounts).

You can however link one account, import games, link a different  account, import games again and you'll end up with a library that  contains games from both accounts.
Playnite never automatically removes  games from the library so linking a different account won't affect games from other accounts in any way.

### Does Playnite support X controller?

See [Controller Support](../playniteFullscreenMode.md#controller-support).

### Where can I find the library folder with all games?

Go to `Settings` menu and check `Database Location` on `Advanced` tab.

By default for installed versions the library is in `%appdata%\Playnite\library` folder and for portable it's just `library` folder inside the application folder.

> [!WARNING]
> Never combine two different library folders from  different Playnite instances. It will generate duplicates in your  library. If you are moving library to another Playnite instance always  completely replace the folder, never just copy one over another!

### Where are cover and background images stored?

All media files are stored in `Database Location` directory together with other game information.

### How do I update Playnite?

Playnite supports auto update feature, you don't have to download and install updates manually. Playnite checks for new version at every  startup and then every 4 hours. You can also manually check if new  version is available by using `Check for Updates` menu option.

### Where are Playnite settings located?

Portable editions have settings stored in `config.json` directly in Playnite's folder. Installed versions store settings in the `%AppData%\Playnite\config.json` file.

### What is Safe Mode?

Safe Mode starts Playnite with all 3rd party extensions disabled and using only default theme.

You can start safe by opening going to the `Main menu` -> `Help` -> *Restart in Safe* mode or by opening the  `Safe Mode.bat` file from Playnite's installation directory or by using `--safestartup` argument when starting Playnite's executable.

### How do I start additional application(s) before game starts and kill it after game exits?

See [this page](../../02_Features/scriptingSupport/exampleScripts.md#starting-additional-applications-before-game-starts-and-killing-it-after-game-exits).

### How do I unhide game?

Use the "funnel" filter button next to the search field to open filter panel, select `Hidden` filter, right-click on hidden games and choose the `Show in Library` option.

### How do I close (emulated) game with a controller?

Playnite has no built-in functionality for it right now. If a game (or an emulator) doesn't have a way to ecoverxit via some menu, you will need to use a 3rd party app that can simulate `ALT+F4` with a controller button.  Some example of apps you can use include [JoyXoff]([JoyXoff](https://joyxoff.com/en/)), [AntiMicroX](https://antimicrox.github.io/), [Controller Companion](http://controllercompanion.com/) and [reWASD](https://www.rewasd.com/).
